### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Christopher Fong, pleasure to meet you :)

<h3>About me</h3>
I am studying computer science at Simon Fraser University, but in my free time I love to explore various facets of programming that can be used to improve 
quality of life! 

<p>I believe the possibilities with software development are limitless, so I am dedicating this github to documenting my journey of exploration through these endless avenues</p>

<h3>Where to find me</h3>
I love to meet new people and talk about anything! Connect with me on my socials below!
